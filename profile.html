      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>Originally from the States, I have lived in Australia for almost 3 years. I moved over to be with my partner of 5 years and am currently on a partner visa with plans to stay indefinitely.<br><br>
        My website is a throwback to old flash websites. As a baby of the 90s I grew up on flash games and websites and they were the first thing that drew me to the web and eventually an interest in web development. My website is meant to have a fun and nostalgic feel.
